# GameEngine-demo-
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A vary early attempt at a full game engine ( created in 2020 )  ( now depreciated // no plans for future development )

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
> All files, all images, all libraries were writen/created by Steven Andrews II.

This was a vary early attempt at creating a 2.5D top-down graphics engine to support a game inspired by the anime ( Cowboy bebop )
utilizing a free to use 2d game engine ( love 2d ). The entire engine is writen in LUA. 

Developer notes: 

I never finished the demo development, so many features are in the code itself yet can not be accesed by the user via gamepad control or any other UI. 
To actually change the characters weapon you have to manually change the selected weapon in the mod.lua file. 

I used this code as a test bed for new styles of writing and handling data structures in new and unique ways for game/app creation. Although I never finished the project or took it further than what it is. I gaind valuable knowledge and skill for future application desgine and development as well as large project managment. 


To run the game:
> You must install love 2D ( 11.0 or greater !)
>
> click on the .love file ( select open with --- > select love2d  )



Note: Git hub wouldnt allow me to upload the enitre thing in one go. File is over 30 MB of data. Run the .love file
